# PitchPerfect
Udacity's PitchPerfect project.

PitchPerfect is first portfolio app built in my journy in Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree.

This app records a conversation between you and a friend, and then alters your voices to sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader.

# Prerequisites
It was built using Xcode Version 10.1, along with Swift 4.2 .
